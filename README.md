# ray_tracing
ray tracing algorithm for oceanography

the code runs a simulation for ray tracing, according to the data in Kunze 1985.
fits midlatitude open ocean, southward geostrophic jet.

simulation parameters:
2 option for background flows: barotropic and baroclinic.
angle between wave and flow.
starting coordinate.
